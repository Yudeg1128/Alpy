Summary tables (Doc 10-11) and narrative mentions (Doc 1-3) presented values in billions of MNT (тэрбум төгрөг) or millions of MNT (сая төгрөг), despite some table headings stating different units (e.g., 'сая төгрөгөөр' when values were in billions). Based on the magnitude relative to the bond principal (1,000,000,000 MNT) and consistency across documents, values from summary tables and narrative were interpreted as billions of MNT and converted to base MNT by multiplying by 1,000,000,000. Equity components were primarily sourced from the summary table (Doc 10-11) due to apparent incompleteness in the detailed table (Doc 4-5).

Doc 1-3 provided narrative confirmation of key figures and periods. Doc 12-13 and 14-15 provided supporting details and verification for some line items. The main challenge was reconciling unit inconsistencies across documents, particularly in Doc 10-11 where table headings contradicted the apparent magnitude of values.

As of 2024, there are 573 NBFIs operating with a total of 5.4 million customers. The sector's total assets reached 7.1 trillion MNT, an increase of 2.5 trillion MNT from the previous year. Total loans amounted to 5.75 trillion MNT, with 90.5% extended to individuals. The sector is in a growth stage, driven by increasing demand for consumer loans, widespread adoption of Fintech technology, the need to expand financial access in underserved areas, and relatively softer lending criteria compared to banks.",

Key success factors include the adoption of Fintech technology, sound risk management practices, and customer-centric services.",
