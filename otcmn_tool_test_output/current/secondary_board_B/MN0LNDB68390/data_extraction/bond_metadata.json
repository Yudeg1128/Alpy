  "comments": "Extracted core bond metadata. Trustee/Paying Agent, Default Interest Rate, Call/Put provisions, and Listing Venue were not explicitly stated in the provided documents. Listing venue is inferred as not publicly listed based on the description 'хаалттай хүрээнд' (closed circle/private placement). Issue date is taken from the 'Announced Date' as the closest available date related to the bond offering start.",
  "input_quality": "Extraction relied primarily on documents 1, 2, and 5, which contained the most direct information about the specific bond (ISIN MN0LNDB68390). Document 3 and 6 provided supporting evidence for the typical denomination used by the issuer. Document 4 was irrelevant. The principal amount was confirmed across multiple sources and matched the authoritative source value."
