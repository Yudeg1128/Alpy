As of 2024, there are 573 NBFIs operating with a total of 5.4 million customers. The sector's total assets reached 7.1 trillion MNT, an increase of 2.5 trillion MNT from the previous year. Total loans amounted to 5.75 trillion MNT, with 90.5% extended to individuals. The sector is in a growth stage, driven by increasing demand for consumer loans, widespread adoption of Fintech technology, the need to expand financial access in underserved areas, and relatively softer lending criteria compared to banks.",

Key regulatory bodies are the Financial Regulatory Commission and the Bank of Mongolia.",

Data limitations included inconsistent historical line item labels and units requiring normalization, messy and potentially inconsistent PPE/Intangibles data, limited explicit Capex/Depreciation figures, and sparse data for other working capital items.",
    "input_quality_notes": "The input data provided a good mix of historical financials (annual, semi-annual, quarterly), issuer projections (loan portfolio, cash flow summaries), bond metadata, and industry context. However, data quality was mixed. Historical financial statements had inconsistent line item labels and reporting units across periods, requiring careful normalization. Specific line items like depreciation and detailed Capex were not consistently available. PPE/Intangibles balances showed large, potentially inconsistent jumps. Working capital details beyond loans/cash were minimal. Issuer projections were valuable but only extended to 2027 for loans and 2025 for cash flow details. The specific instruction for loan loss provision (using the balance sheet ratio) was followed. Overall, sufficient data was available to build a reasonable set of assumptions, but required judgment calls due to inconsistencies and missing detail.",

This decline is attributed to softer import prices and a slight appreciation of the tugrik. However, core inflation remains elevated due to robust domestic demand and rapid credit growth, prompting the central bank to tighten reserve requirements and debt service-to-income limits for consumer loans."

Mongolia's inflation rate decreased from a peak of 15.15% in 2022 to 9.0% in 2024, aligning with the Bank of Mongolia's target band of 6±2%. This decline is attributed to softer import prices and a slight appreciation of the tugrik. However, core inflation remains elevated due to robust domestic demand and rapid credit growth, prompting the central bank to tighten reserve requirements and debt service-to-income limits for consumer loans.",

The Mongolian tugrik has depreciated against the US dollar over the past three years, with the average exchange rate rising from 2850.0 in 2022 to 3392.02 in 2024. This depreciation reflects Mongolia's external vulnerabilities, including a current account deficit and reliance on commodity exports. However, foreign exchange reserves have remained stable, supported by foreign direct investment and external financing.",
