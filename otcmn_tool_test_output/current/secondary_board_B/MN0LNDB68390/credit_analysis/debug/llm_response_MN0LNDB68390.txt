    "Difficult Mappings": "The most difficult mappings involved distinguishing between general 'other_assets' and the specific 'other_current_assets' historical items, especially since the latter was consistently zero. 'other_assets' was mapped to 'other_current_asset_1' as the most logical general current asset, and the historical 'other_current_assets' (value 0.0) was mapped to 'other_current_asset_2' to ensure full historical coverage. Additionally, correctly identifying 'net_interest_income' as the equivalent of 'gross_profit' for a lender and mapping 'impairment_loss_on_loans' to 'industry_specific_operating_expenses' were crucial for financial logic. Mapping 'loans_receivable_gross' and 'non_performing_loans_amount' to 'industry_specific_subtotals' rather than assets was also important, adhering to Rule A.1.2.1. Finally, ensuring that 'total_current_liabilities' and 'total_non_current_liabilities' were set to null, as they were not explicitly provided as separate historical line items, was a key correction.",
    "Key Model Selection": "The projection model selected for revenue_stream_1 (Interest Income) was 'Asset_Yield_Driven'. This choice was directly justified by the <BUSINESS_PROFILE> which states: 'The issuer is a non-bank financial institution primarily engaged in lending activities. It operates a 100% fintech technology-based digital loan application... The company generates revenue primarily from interest income on its loan portfolio and loan repayments.' This clearly indicates that revenue is generated from a balance sheet asset (loan portfolio) and its yield.",
    "Most Significant Driver": "The single most significant driver baseline value generated is the 'industry_specific_asset_growth_rate' for 'loans_receivable_net', set at 25%. This driver directly dictates the growth of the company's primary earning asset. My confidence in its calculation and applicability is moderately high. While the company's historical loan growth (88.47% from 2022 to 2023) is exceptionally high, a 25% baseline, moderating to 10% in the terminal period, reflects a more sustainable yet still aggressive expansion for a high-growth fintech NBFI, supported by the stated use of bond proceeds for portfolio expansion in the <BUSINESS_PROFILE>. It acknowledges the company's growth trajectory while factoring in eventual market saturation and regulatory pressures mentioned in the <MACRO_CONTEXT>.",
    "Confidence Score": 0.9,
    "Justification": "The populated schema adheres meticulously to all specified rules, including the strict hierarchy of precedence. Every historical financial line item has been mapped to its most logical slot, ensuring 100% coverage and structural integrity. The primary business model (NBFI lender) was correctly identified, guiding critical mapping decisions (e.g., interest income as revenue, interest expense as COGS) and the mandated 'Asset_Yield_Driven' model selection for revenue. All required drivers have been populated with baselines derived from historical data and contextualized with industry and macroeconomic insights from <MACRO_CONTEXT>, with clear, auditable justifications. The exclusion of the cash flow statement and summation plugs was strictly followed. The only minor uncertainty lies in projecting the precise moderation of the company's exceptionally high historical loan growth, which is inherently subjective but has been addressed with a reasoned approach."
