    "Difficult Mappings": "The most difficult mappings involved `depreciation_amortization` which had to be mapped to both `depreciation_expense` and `amortization_expense` due to Rule A.1.2 (Law of Required Duplication). Additionally, `loans_receivable_gross` was challenging as it is an aggregate of a primary asset (`loans_receivable_net`) and a contra-asset (`loan_loss_reserve`), and per Rule A.1.2.1, it had to be mapped to `industry_specific_subtotals` rather than `industry_specific_assets`. Finally, `intangible_additions_annual` required using `cf_from_change_in_intangible_assets` from the cash flow statement as a proxy for additions, which is a net change rather than gross additions, but was the most logical available data point.",
    "Key Model Selection": "The projection model selected for revenue was 'Asset_Yield_Driven'. This choice was directly justified by the <BUSINESS_PROFILE> which states: 'The issuer is a non-bank financial institution primarily engaged in lending activities. It operates a 100% fintech technology-based digital loan application... The company generates revenue primarily from interest income on its loan portfolio and loan repayments.' This clearly indicates that revenue is generated from a balance sheet asset (loans receivable) and is yield-driven.",
    "Most Significant Driver": "The single most significant driver baseline value generated is the `industry_specific_asset_growth_rate` for `loans_receivable_net`, with a baseline of 88.47%. This is critical because the company's primary business is lending, and the growth of its loan portfolio directly drives its main revenue stream. I am moderately confident in its calculation as it's a direct historical growth rate. However, its applicability for future projections requires significant moderation, as the historical growth is exceptionally high and unsustainable, necessitating a strong convergence to industry averages as per the trends.",
    "Confidence Score": 0.9,
    "justification": "The populated schema is a financially logical representation of the issuer. All historical financial line items were mapped, adhering to the specific rules for NBFIs (e.g., interest income as primary revenue, interest expense as primary COGS). Drivers were calculated using 2023 historical data and justified with references to the provided context. The model selection for revenue aligns perfectly with the business profile. The main area of lower confidence is the projection of exceptionally high historical growth rates (e.g., loans receivable) to more sustainable levels, which inherently involves judgment beyond direct historical extrapolation, but is necessary for financial logic."

The user asked for the output to be a single JSON markdown block. I have provided that.
I have followed all rules:
- Rule A.0: Identified NBFI, mapped `interest_income` to `revenue_stream_1` and `interest_expense` to `cost_of_revenue_1`. Set `non_operating_income_expense.interest_income` and `interest_expense` to `null`.
- Rule A.1: Mapped every single financial line item from historical data.
- Rule A.1.1: Used `other_current_asset_1`, `other_non_current_asset_1`, `other_current_liability_1`, `other_equity_1` for flexible mappings.
- Rule A.1.2: Mapped `depreciation_amortization` to both `depreciation_expense` and `amortization_expense`.
- Rule A.1.2.1: Mapped `loans_receivable_gross` to `industry_specific_subtotal_1`.
- Rule A.1.3: Ensured no double-booking that violates accounting principles.
- Rule A.2: Set `historical_account_key` to `null` for items with no corresponding historical data or after re-mapping (e.g., non-operating interest).
- Rule A.3: Created distinct entries for `long_term_debt` instruments.
- Rule A.4: Mapped `loan_loss_reserve` to `contra_assets` and `treasury_stock` to `contra_equity`.
- Rule B.1 & B.1.1: Selected `Asset_Yield_Driven` model for `revenue_stream_1`, populated `is_lender` and `target_asset_account` correctly.
- Rule B.2: Did not add or modify `__engine_logic__` or `projection_model` where not allowed.
- Rule B.3: Excluded cash flow statement from the output.
- Rule C.1: Populated all fields within pre-defined `drivers` objects.
- Rule C.2: Provided auditable justifications referencing source data.
- Rule D: Adhered to structural integrity for drivers.
- Rule E: Mapped primary revenue and cost of revenue correctly.
- Rule F: Calculated all rates and ratios intelligently (e.g., asset yield, SGA as % of revenue, implied interest rate, debt as % of assets, dividend payout ratio, asset growth rate).
- Rule G: Excluded cash flow statement and summation plugs.
- Section IV: Added `__reasoning_log__` with all required points.

The JSON is syntactically perfect.
The financial logic is consistent with an NBFI.
All justifications are confined to the `justification` field.
