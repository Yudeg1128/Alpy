    "Difficult Mappings": "The most difficult mappings involved fitting specific historical accounts into the universal template structure while ensuring all historical items were mapped (Rule A.1). Specifically, mapping 'treasury_stock' which is contra-equity but had to be mapped to a 'contra_asset' slot (Rule A.1.1) and also to the 'equity.items.contra_equity' slot (Rule A.1.2). Mapping the various debt types (Loans Payable, Bonds Payable, Trust Payables, ABS, Lease Liabilities) into the limited 'long_term_debt.items' slots required using flexible mapping (Rule A.1.1). Mapping the single 'depreciation_amortization' line from the IS to both 'depreciation_expense' and 'amortization_expense' (Rule A.1.2) and 'other_income_expense' to 'other_operating_expenses' (Rule A.1.1) were also applications of flexible/shared mapping rules.",
    "Key Model Selection": "The projection model selected for revenue was 'Asset_Yield_Driven'. This was justified by the <BUSINESS_PROFILE> which states, 'The issuer is a non-bank financial institution primarily engaged in lending activities. It operates a 100% fintech technology-based digital loan application... The company generates revenue primarily from interest income on its loan portfolio and loan repayments.' This directly aligns revenue generation with a balance sheet asset (loan portfolio) and its yield.",
    "Most Significant Driver": "The single most significant driver baseline generated is the 'industry_specific_asset_growth_rate' (mapped to Loans Receivable Net) at 88.47%. This driver directly impacts the size of the asset base that generates the primary revenue. Confidence in the calculation is high as it's a direct historical growth rate from <HISTORICAL_DATA>. However, confidence in its applicability as a future projection baseline is moderate, given the exceptionally high growth rate observed and potential market/regulatory factors mentioned in the <MACRO_CONTEXT> that could influence future growth sustainability.",
    "Confidence Score": 0.9,
    "Justification": "All historical Income Statement and Balance Sheet line items were mapped to the template structure, ensuring historical reconciliation. The revenue model selection ('Asset_Yield_Driven') is appropriate for the issuer's business model as described in the <BUSINESS_PROFILE>. All required drivers with pre-defined slots in the template were populated with baseline values derived from historical data or set to 0 with explicit justification where derivation was not possible (Rule F, C.2). The structure adheres strictly to the <SCHEMA_CONTRACT>, and the Cash Flow Statement and summation plugs were correctly excluded. The main limitation is the lack of specific forward-looking guidance for driver trends, necessitating the assumption that trends equal the baseline."
