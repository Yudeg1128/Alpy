    "Full historical financial statements and, most importantly, comprehensive Markdown tables containing official annual and quarterly reports, balance sheets (ХОРОНГО), income statements (Орлогын үзүүлэлтүүд), cash flow statements, statements of changes in equity, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Prioritize extracting data from Markdown tables that clearly present multi-year financial data with column and row headers and numerical values, focusing on the most recent and complete tables.

Prefer tables over narrative or unstructured text whenever possible.",
    "Issuer-provided financial projections, forecast tables, future financial outlook, projected income statements, projected balance sheets, and forward-looking metrics such as projected revenue, projected EBITDA, or future capital expenditures for all projection periods. Look for phrases like 'ирээдүйн таамаглал' (future forecast) or 'төлөвлөгөөт үзүүлэлтүүд' (planned indicators).",
