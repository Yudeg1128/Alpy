        "summary": "Mongolia's non-banking financial institutions sector is a vital component of the country's financial system, comprising approximately 188 licensed NBFIs serving a population of 3.4 million people. The sector includes microfinance institutions, leasing companies, pawnshops, and savings and credit cooperatives, playing a crucial role in financial inclusion by providing credit access to underserved consumers and small businesses. NBFIs account for approximately 78% of all borrowers by number in Mongolia, despite representing only 8-10% of total outstanding credit by value. The sector has experienced rapid growth, with loan portfolios increasing 35% in 2022 to reach MNT 2.7 trillion (approximately USD 800 million).",

The sector benefits from strong economic fundamentals with GDP growth of 4.7% in 2023 and projected 5%+ growth in 2024, driven by mining sector expansion. However, regulatory tightening through interest rate caps and DTI limits will pressure margins and constrain growth for some institutions. Digital transformation and fintech adoption will accelerate consolidation, favoring larger, technology-enabled players. The sector's role in financial inclusion remains crucial, with opportunities in underserved SME financing and rural markets. Success will depend on effective risk management, regulatory compliance, and adaptation to evolving consumer preferences for digital financial services."
